 * Created by yongyangyu on 8/7/15.
 * Catalan number, C(n) = (2*n \choose n) / (n + 1).
 * The problem is to calculate the number of unique BST.
 * To do so, we need to define two functions:

 * G(n): the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.

 * F(i, n), 1 <= i <= n: the number of unique BST, where the number i is the
 * root of BST, and the sequence ranges from 1 to n.
 * As one can see, G(n) is the actual function we need to calculate in order
 * to solve the problem. And G(n) can be derived from F(i, n), which at the end,
 * would recursively refer to G(n).

 * First of all, given the above definitions, we can see that the total number of
 * unique BST G(n), is the sum of BST F(i) using each number i as a root. i.e.
 * G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n).
 * Particularly, the bottom cases, there is only one combination to construct a BST out
 * of a sequence of length 1 (only a root) or 0 (empty tree). i.e.
 * G(0)=1, G(1)=1.
 * Given a sequence 1â€¦n, we pick a number i out of the sequence as the root, then the number
 * of unique BST with the specified root F(i), is the cartesian product of the number of BST
 * for its left and right subtrees. For example, F(3, 7): the number of unique BST tree with
 * number 3 as its root. To construct an unique BST out of the entire sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
 * with 3 as the root, which is to say, we need to construct an unique BST out of its left subsequence
 * [1, 2] and another BST out of the right subsequence [4, 5, 6, 7], and then combine them together
 * (i.e. cartesian product). The tricky part is that we could consider the number of unique BST out
 * of sequence [1,2] as G(2), and the number of of unique BST out of sequence [4, 5, 6, 7] as G(4).
 * Therefore, F(3,7) = G(2) * G(4).
 *
 * i.e.

 * F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i)   1 <= i <= n
