# Interview
This repository serves as a backup of source code of programming interviews. Some of the questions come from [*Leetcode*](https://leetcode.com/) online judge; some from the book ***Elements of Programming Interviews*** [EPI](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439071486&sr=8-1&keywords=element+of+programming+interview); and some from the interviews of my own experience. Some early questions come up with solutions only. More recent questions come up with both the problem description and the solution.
